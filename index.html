introduction: |
  I love to understand the ins and outs of how technology works, and often find myself down the rabbit hole reading documentation, technical specifications, 
  RFCs, etc.
  
  Too many times, I found myself spending a great deal of time researching a topic, but forgetting quite a bit about it a few months later because I 
  didn't take any notes.<br>
  So I've decided to start taking notes and to make them decent enough that I can publish them, as it will force me to organize my thoughts clearly, 
  and hopefully other people can benefit from them.
