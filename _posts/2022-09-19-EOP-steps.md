Have you ever wondered how emails are processed by EOP? If so, please read on.

#### <u>EOP steps:</u>

![tp_emailprocessingineopt3.png](/assets/images/tp_emailprocessingineopt3.png)

1. **Connection filtering**, which checks the sender's **reputation** (IP based)
2. **Anti-malware** (used to perform bulk and phish checks at this step in the past)
3. **Mail transport rules** (if a rule redirects to a connector, it will still go throught the next step/phase before being sent to that connector)
4. **Content filtering**
	- **Anti-spam policies**, which actually look for spam, bulk messages, and phishing
	- **Anti-phishing policies**, which actually look for spoofing (EOP and ATP aka Defender), and impersonation (ATP aka Defender only). The difference between spoofing and impersonation is that a person pretending to be user@company.com is spoofing, while a person pretending to be user@compan**v**.com is impersonating (real domain created to look like target domain) 

#### <u>Order of processing by email protection type:</u>

| Order | Email protection                         | Category  |
|-------|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1     | Malware                                  | CAT:MALW  |
| 2     | Phishing                                 | CAT:PHSH  |
| 3     | High confidence spam                     | CAT:HSPM  |
| 4     | Spoofing                                 | CAT:SPOOF |
| 5     | User impersonation (protected users)     | CAT:UIMP  |
| 6     | Domain impersonation (protected domains) | CAT:DIMP  |
| 7     | Spam                                     | CAT:SPM   |
| 8     | Bulk                                     | CAT:BLK   |

**#5 and #6 are only available in ATP (aka Defender).**

A policy that's applied to a message is identified in the **X-Forefront-Antispam-Report** header in the **CAT** (Category) **property**.

<mark>Once there's a hit on a particular category, the processing stops.</mark>
